👋 Hi there, I'm Rythem!

I'm a self-taught full stack web developer with a passion for creating clean, responsive, and interactive user experiences. I specialize in React, Node.js, and PostgreSQL, and enjoy bringing designs to life with tools like Tailwind CSS, DaisyUI, and GSAP for animations.

🛠️ **Tech Stack**  
- **Frontend:** React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, DaisyUI, GSAP, SVG  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, REST APIs  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL, Prisma  
- **Other:** Git, GitHub, Linux, Babel, ESLint

🎯 **What I'm working on**  
- Building scroll-triggered animated websites using React + GSAP  
- Creating reusable components and mini-games to improve my dev toolkit  
- Preparing to launch my freelancing portfolio to start offering services  

💡 **Fun Fact**  
I love taking on the technical challenges most people avoid — especially if it means learning something new along the way!
