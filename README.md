Hey there! Iâ€™m Rythem ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a self-taught web developer whoâ€™s obsessed with building cool, interactive apps. 
Iâ€™ve got a strong foundation in JavaScript and React, and Iâ€™m always diving into new tools and frameworks (mostly so I can say "I can totally build that" when a challenge comes up).

ðŸ”§ Tech Stack:

  Languages: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Motoko (Learning)

  Frameworks: React, Node.js, Express

  Tools: Git, GitHub, Tailwind CSS, DaisyUI, Bootstrap

  Databases: PostgreSQL

ðŸ›  Currently Building:

  Memory Card Game â€“ A fun game where you match cards and test your memory (no actual mind reading involved).

  Portfolio Website â€“ A place where I pretend to be a professional web developer.

ðŸ’¬ Letâ€™s Talk!

Got a project or just want to chat about React? Open an issue or ping me â€” I promise Iâ€™m friendly (and I know how to debug, most of the time).
